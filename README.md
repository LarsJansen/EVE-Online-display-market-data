# EVE-Online-display-market-data
Simple PHP system to fetch EVE market data to a MySQL db and then display that data online. Includes percentage change from previous row.

Contains two files which are fairly self explanatory. Also an sql file to create your database with some demo data.
This app is probably NOT suitable for large quantities of items. There are better systems around, for example go check out https://github.com/fuzzysteve

I use this code to display a nice ticker with market data at http://quafezero.com (quafezero.com being a development playground for me rather than an actual production site that gets actual visitors:)

## PSA: I'm no programmer, so use my code at your peril:)
